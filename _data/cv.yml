    - title: Full-time Machine Learning Specialist
      institution: Panafor, Karaj, Iran
      year: April 2022 - Jan 2024
      description:
        - <strong>Summary:</strong> Specializing in Data-driven Decision Making for Business Optimization.
        - <span>The Problem:</span> <strong>Implemented an AI-driven solution to address the challenge of prioritizing customers applications in the tourism sector.</strong>
        - <span>Impact:</span> Decreased personnel error by 10\%, <strong>mitigating potential losses equivalent to 5.5 times my annual salary.</strong> Also, <strong>awarded for dedication and leadership</strong>, leading to two promotions and a 70\% salary increase within one year. Moreover, <strong>I established myself as the primary resource for onboarding and training</strong> new team members, receiving praise for my ability to simplify fundamental concepts.
        - Developed a comprehensive screening process automation from customer communication to application prioritization, filtering calls based on the complexity of inquiries, <strong>reducing manual workload by 40\%.</strong>
        - Oversaw the development of a proprietary data extraction and preprocessing pipeline, resulting in a <strong>35\% reduction in poor-quality data</strong>.
        - Deployed classical machine learning models alongside deep learning methods, coupled with Explainable AI techniques to prioritize applications and provide transparent reasoning for each decision.
        - This experience demonstrates my ability to leverage AI technologies to optimize decision-making processes, drive significant business outcomes, and collaborate effectively with stakeholders from various backgrounds.
