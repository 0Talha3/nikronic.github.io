I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and currently work as a machine learning engineer, specializing in the development of data-driven decision-making systems for business optimization. Previously, I completed a research internship with the Artificial Intelligence Aided Design and Manufacturing (<a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">AIDAM</a>) group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (<a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/">MPI-INF</a>). During my time there, I focused on Structural Topology Optimization (TO) using Deep Learning (DL) under the supervision of <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid">Dr. Vahid Babaei</a>, the AIDAM group leader, and in collaboration with <a href="https://julianpanetta.com/">Prof. Julian Panetta</a>, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis. This opportunity allowed me to realize the importance and applicability of AI in conjunction with science & engineering, and highlighted the exciting possibilities of interdisciplinary research. Before this, my work centered around classical digital image processing, deep computer vision, and data science.

In my spare time, I play video games, read about history, and I like standup comedy. I'm also passionate about open-source projects and consider GitHub my primary social media platform.

Currently, I am actively seeking an exceptional PhD opportunity where I can further explore and contribute to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas that intersect with science and engineering.
