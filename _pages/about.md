Through my research, I like to produce practical and accessible tools to be used by scientists, content creators, engineers, and end-users as a connecting media between different domains. I plan to do this by devising self-supervised physics-aware deep learning method. I am interested in applications of AI (mostly deep learning) in computer graphics, science, and generally digital twin. Currently, I am looking for an unique PhD opportunity and I plan to continue my research career in industry!

I am a MSc Computer Engineering graduate from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and I am working as a machine learning engineer. Previously, I did a research internship in Artificial Intelligence aided Design and Manufacturing (<a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">AIDAM</a>) group at Max Planck Institut f√ºr Informatik (<a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/">MPI-INF</a>). I worked on Structural Topology Optimization (TO) via Deep Learning (DL) under supervision of <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid">Dr. Vahid Babaei</a> (AIDAM group leader) and in collaboration with <a href="https://julianpanetta.com/">Prof. Julian Panetta</a> (Assistant Professor at University of California, Davis). We published this work in <a href="https://scf.acm.org">ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication</a>. This opportunity allowed me to realize the importance and applicability of AI in conjunction with science, and interdisciplinary work. Prior to that, I was mainly focused on classic digital image processing and data driven deep computer vision, and data science. In the past of couple of years I grew interest in applications of AI in medicine and computational neuroscience but I was not lucky enough to professionally work on it.

In my spare time, I play video games, read about history, and I like comedy (standup). On top of that, I find the idea and practice of open source amazing and I use Github as my main social media app.
