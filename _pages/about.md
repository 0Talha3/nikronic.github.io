Through my research, I like to produce practical and accessible tools to be used by scientists, content creators, engineers, and end-users as a connecting media between different domains. I plan to do this by devising self-supervised physics-aware deep learning method. I am interested in computer graphics and applications of deep learning in computer graphics.

I am a MSc Computer Engineering graduate from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and I am working as a machine learning engineer. Previously, I did a research internship in Artificial Intelligence aided Design and Manufacturing (AIDAM) group at <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/">Max Planck Institut f√ºr Informatik</a> (MPI-INF). I worked on Structural Topology Optimization (TO) via Deep Learning (DL) under supervision of <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid">Vahid Babaei</a> (AIDAM group leader) and in collaboration with <a href="https://julianpanetta.com/">Julian Panetta</a> (Assistant Professor at University of California, Davis). We published this work in <a href="https://scf.acm.org/2022/">ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication</a> as my first-ever peer-reviewed publication. That was when I resolved my doubts about being a research scientist! Hence, I am looking for an unique PhD opportunity.

In my spare time (and quiet a few times before the deadlines :D), I play video games, read about history, watch standup comedy, and spam KEKW and OMEGALUL on Twitch for no obvious reason. On top of that, I like open source and I use Github as my main social media app.
