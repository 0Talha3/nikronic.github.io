I have been promoted to Team Leader, where I now lead a team consisting of one full-time Data Scientist and two Artificial Intelligence interns.

As this was my first time being assigned as a team leader in an industry position, I aimed to create a robust system for both myself and others. In this regard, I redesigned the entire recruitment process, developed comprehensive problem-solving and technical knowledge exams, and created a 3-month educational plan focused on key paradigms. I successfully standardized best practices within the company and my department, including communication, presentation, software engineering, data versioning, and more.
