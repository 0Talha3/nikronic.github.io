I have been promoted to Team Leader, where I now lead a team consisting of one full-time Data Scientist and two Artificial Intelligence interns.

As this was the first time I was assigned as a team leader in an indsutry position, I tried to create a robust system for me and others. On this regard, I redesigned the entire recruitment process, developed comprehensive problem-solving and technical knowledge exams, and created a 3-month educational plan focused on key paradigms that I have successfully standardized within the company and my department such best practices in communication, presentation, software engineering, data versioning and so on.
